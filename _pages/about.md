<span style="color:red">**I will be joining the [Department of Computer Science at Florida State University](https://www.cs.fsu.edu) as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Fall 2024.**</span>

<span style="color:red">**\[Recruiting PhDs & Interns\]:**</span> I am actively seeking ambitious students for Ph.D. or research intern roles. Please [email me](mailto:yd6eb@virginia.edu) with your CV, transcripts, and brief descriptions of your preferred research topics. Kindly mark the subject with *[PhD/Research Intern Application]* to ensure attention.


I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/) working with [Prof. Jundong Li](https://jundongli.github.io).

**(i) Research Summary:** My research interest mainly lies in achieving responsible AI to further advance social good such as facilitating inclusive decision-making. I have abundant research works under related topics with a particular focus on relational data, including **27 published research papers (nine first-author ones)** in the following areas [[see full list]](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=_QUhuOMAAAAJ):

* **Explainability:** Model Interpretability; Prediction Justification  
* **Algorithmic Fairness:** Fairness Measurement; Algorithm Debiasing  
* **Safety:** Attack and Defense
* **AI/ML+X (Applications):** Healthcare; Recommendation  

**(ii) Highlighted Honors:** I received [**Louis T. Rader Graduate Research Award**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jundong-li-09151b5b_uva-research-phd-activity-7057847052566683648-0NzM?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), [**Endowed Fellowship**](https://engineering.virginia.edu/yushun-dong-earns-endowed-graduate-fellowship), and [**Best Poster @Doctoral Forum of SDM 2022**](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/sdm22). I am truly grateful for the generous efforts from the associated institutions and organizers.

**(iii) Highlighted Project:** I initiated and have been managing the open-source tool [PyGDebias <img src="../files/pygdebias.png" alt="" style="float:right;" width="400"/>](https://github.com/yushundong/PyGDebias) — a Python library featured for 20+ built-in datasets and 10+ implementations of popular fairness-aware graph learning algorithms. 


<!-- I have abundant interest in **Graph Mining**, e.g., **Spectral Graph Theory**, **Graph Neural Networks** and corresponding interdisciplinary topics. -->
<!-- My previous research experiences mainly lie in graph mining and feature fusion. -->
