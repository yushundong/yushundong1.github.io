<h2 id="description"><u>Description</u></h2>
Graph data is ubiquitous in diverse real-world applications. To gain a deeper understanding of these graphs, graph mining algorithms have been playing a significant role over the years. Nevertheless, most graph mining algorithms lack fairness consideration. As a consequence, they could render discriminatory results against certain demographic subgroups or individuals. Such potential discrimination leads to an increasing societal concern about alleviating the bias exhibited in graph mining algorithms. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent research progress in measuring and mitigating the bias exhibited in graph mining algorithms. Specifically, we first introduce several widely-used fairness notions and the corresponding metrics. Then, we present an organized summary of existing techniques to debias graph mining algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate how different real-world applications benefit from these graph mining algorithms after debiasing. Finally, we provide insights on current research challenges and open questions to encourage further advances.

<h3>Part 1: Introduction </a> </h3>
  
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>Background and Motivation.</li>
<li>An overview of graph mining tasks that have been studied on algorithmic bias mitigation.</li> 
<li>An overview of the applications which benefit from debiased graph mining algorithms.</li>
</ul>
  
<h3>Part 2: Fairness Notions and Metrics in Graph Mining </a> </h3>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>Why is it necessary to define fairness in different ways?</li>
<li>Group Fairness: graph mining algorithms should not render discriminatory predictions or decisions against individuals from any specific sensitive subgroup.</li>  
<li>Individual Fairness: graph mining algorithms should render similar predictions for similar individuals.</li>
<li>Counterfactual Fairness: an individual should receive similar predictions when his/her features are perturbed in a counterfactual manner.</li>
<li>Degree-Related Fairness: nodes with different degree values in the graph should receive similar quality of predictions.</li>
<li>Application-Specific Fairness: fairness notions defined in specific real-world applications.</li>
</ul>

<li>Re-balancing.</li>
<li>Orthogonal projection.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Part 4: Real-World Application Scenarios</h3>
  
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>Recommender systems.</li>
<li>Applications based on knowledge graphs.</li>
<li>Other real-world applications, including candidate-job matching, criminal justice, transportation optimization, credit default prediction, etc.</li>
</ul>
